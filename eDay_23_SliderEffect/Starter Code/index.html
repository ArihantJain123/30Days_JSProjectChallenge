              Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory
              droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing. A face
              covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles
              containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the
              chances of infection.

            <p>
              Not wearing masks can make you prone to Covid 19 viral strain
              directly impacts the lungs, reducing its capacity and limiting the
              intake of oxygen and leading to ARDS and pneumonia. It is
              especially deadly in individuals who have underlying illnesses,
              and respiratory complications or both.
